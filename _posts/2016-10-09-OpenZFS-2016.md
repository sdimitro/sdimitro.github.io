summary: My experience of the OpenZFS Summit 2016
---

On September 26th I had the pleasure of going to the OpenZFS Developer
Summit of 2016. You can find more information on the event (slides,
videos, etc..)
[here](http://open-zfs.org/wiki/OpenZFS_Developer_Summit_2016).
The event itself was great. Many great speakers shared their experience
with ZFS and how they use it in their everyday job. Brian Behlendorf, for
example, presented how ZFS is used together with Lustre in supercomputers
in the Livermore National Lab, and the modifications that his team had
to do to ZFS in order for it to serve their use-case. Other presentations
showcased cool features and improvements to ZFS with the goal of
receiving feedback or raising awareness on issues like making the ZFS
test-suite uniform across the different operating systems.

What I personally found as the most important aspect of the summit was
the fact that many people from the community were gathered together in
one place. You would hear interesting discussions everywhere. From how
individuals first got involved with ZFS to deeply technical discussions
on why ZFS is the way it is. Jeff Bonwick also showed up at the end of
that day but unfortunately I had to go at that time so I only met him
briefly.

Another cool thing about the summit for a newcomer like me was that I
got to meet in person people from Delphix and the ZFS community that
I've been exchanging emails, in person. For example, Richard Elling
was the first person to review my first code submission ever in ZFS
two years ago, when I was still a student. It was cool talking with him
in person.

Finally, the hackathon in the second day of the summit was an amazing
experience. Individuals from different companies formed teams to work
on new features of ZFS or to refine existing ones. Dan Kimmel and I
quickly hacked together zpool checkpointing with the help of George
Wilson who was basically helping several different groups while also
working on his own project. I had a lot of fun working in zpool
checkpointing with Dan and George, and hopefully we'll put some time
in the future to do a proper rewrite of it and upstream it.

Overall, I had a great time in the summit and I'm already looking
forward to the next one.
