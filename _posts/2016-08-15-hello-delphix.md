This is not the standard post that comes with a problem,
some motivation, an objective, and a proposed solution.
This post is just an update
and an opportunity for me to share some great news.

Next week I will be joining the ZFS team of Delphix in
their San Francisco office.  Systems programming/engineering
has always been the most enjoyable area of computers for me
and I believe that this is what I want to do. Having said that,
I believe there is not better place for me to do this than
Delphix. In a way, I feel like a reached a personal Ithaca.

There are no words to express how excited I am for
this opportunity. I look forward to learn from and work with
Matthew Ahrens, George Wilson, Dan Kimmel, and other heroes
of the ZFS fame that work at Delphix. I look forward to the
challenges ahead. I look forward to examine some ugly core
dumps :-)
