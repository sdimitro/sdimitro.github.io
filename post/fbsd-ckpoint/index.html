<h3 id="--introduction--">- Introduction -</h3>
<p>In March of this year (2018), Alexander Motin (<code>mav@freebsd.org</code>) ported the Pool Checkpoint
feature of OpenZFS from Illumos to FreeBSD. A pool checkpoint can be thought of as a “poolwide
snapshot” that captures the entire state of the pool at the time the checkpoint is created,
allowing the user to revert the entire pool back to that state or discard it. The generic use
cases are administrative tasks, like OS upgrades, that involve actions that change or destroy
ZFS state and metadata. Examples of such actions are: enabling new pool features, changing
properties of datasets, or destroying snapshots and filesystems. Before undertaking such actions,
administrators can create a checkpoint of their pool and then apply their changes. If something
goes wrong with the upgrade, the administrator can then rewind back to the checkpoint as if the
actions had never been taken. In the same way a snapshot can help you return user data to a
previous state, the checkpoint can help you return the ZFS pool to a previous state. There are
already two tutorials online demonstrating how to use this feature, and a block comment in the
source code that gives a high-level overview of its implementation (see the References box).
This article lies somewhere in the middle, giving a high-level description of what happens under
the hood during each administrative operation.</p>
<h3 id="--checkpointing-a-pool--">- Checkpointing a Pool -</h3>
<p>In ZFS we keep track of changes over time with Transaction Groups (aka TXGs). During each TXG,
ZFS accumulates changes in memory and, when certain conditions are met, it syncs those changes
to disk, then opens the next TXG. Each data block records the TXG during which it was created,
called its birth TXG. Birth TXGs are important for the pool checkpoint feature because they help
us differentiate between blocks created before and after a checkpoint. Finally, a TXG’s last
step when syncing to disk is writing the new uberblock to the beginning and end of each disk in
an area called the ZFS label, which is different from the EFI label.  Each uberblock is the root
of the tree of the entire state of the pool for that TXG. Uberblocks are used during pool import
as a starting point to find the latest version of all of the pool’s data and metadata.</p>
<p>Whenever an administrator checkpoints a pool (with the <code>zpool checkpoint</code> command), ZFS copies
the uberblock of the current TXG to an area within the pool’s state called the Meta-Object Set
(MOS). When this change is synced to disk, the uberblocks from subsequent TXG’s reference the
“checkpointed” uberblock through the MOS.</p>
<h3 id="--the-lifetime-of-a-block-in-a-checkpointed-pool--">- The Lifetime of a Block in a Checkpointed Pool -</h3>
<p>When a checkpoint exists, the process of allocating new blocks stays the same, but the process
of freeing blocks is different. We can’t free blocks that belong to the checkpoint because we
want to be able to rewind back to that point in time. At the same time, we can’t stop freeing
blocks entirely, because that would fill up the pool. Thus, every time we are about to free a
block, we look at its birth TXG and compare it to the TXG of the “checkpointed” uberblock that
we saved in the MOS. If the block was born at or before the TXG of the checkpointed uberblock,
it means that the block is part of the checkpoint (i.e. it is referenced by the checkpointed
uberblock). These “checkpointed” blocks are never actually freed. Instead, we add their ranges
to lists on-disk we call checkpoint spacemaps (there is one per vdev) and leave their segments
marked as allocated so they are not reused by the pool. Blocks whose birth TXGs are after the
checkpoint’s TXG, are not part of the checkpointed state and can be freed normally.</p>
<h3 id="--rewinding-to-the-checkpoint--">- Rewinding to the Checkpoint -</h3>
<p>If administrators want to rewind back to the checkpoint, all they need to do is to export and
then reimport the pool with the rewind option (<code>zpool import --rewind-to-checkpoint</code>). In this
case, the import process takes place as usual, but with one additional step. ZFS first looks
at the current uberblock and from that it finds the checkpointed uberblock in the MOS. Then it
uses the checkpointed uberblock instead of the current uberblock for the import process, effectively
rewinding the pool back to the checkpointed state.  Once the import process is done, the rewind is
complete. The checkpoint spacemaps no longer exist as they were created after the checkpointed
uberblock (which is now the current uberblock). For the same reason, there is no checkpoint
uberblock in the MOS. This means that after rewinding there is no additional cleanup and the pool
no longer has a checkpoint.</p>
<p>It is also possible to import a checkpoint read-only to access the pool in the state it existed
at the time of the checkpoint without actually undoing all of the changes that have happened
since the checkpoint was created. This can allow the administrator to recover specific data or
a filesystem that was destroyed without rolling back the entire pool.</p>
<h3 id="--discarding-the-checkpoint--">- Discarding the Checkpoint -</h3>
<p>If administrators decide to get rid of the checkpoint, they run the discard command
(<code>zpool checkpoint --discard</code>). The command instructs ZFS to get rid of the checkpointed uberblock
from the MOS. At that point, the pool is considered to no longer have a checkpoint, which allows
blocks to be freed normally regardless of their birth TXG. ZFS will also free all the previously
recorded ranges from the checkpoint spacemaps &ndash; the blocks that we couldn’t actually free because
they were referenced by the checkpointed uberblock. The number of these blocks can be quite large
depending on how long the checkpoint has existed and how many changes have been made to the pool.
Freeing them all in a single TXG would be expensive. Instead, ZFS spawns a thread that frees them
over the course of multiple TXGs by prefetching them into memory in chunks and freeing one chunk
per TXG.</p>
<h3 id="--acknowledgement--">- Acknowledgement -</h3>
<p>The development of this feature would not have been possible without the help of my colleagues
from Delphix, especially Dan Kimmel who started the initial prototype with me, and Matt Ahrens
for guiding me every step of the way. I’d also like to thank Alexander Motin for porting the
feature to FreeBSD, and Marius Zaborski for promoting it.</p>
