     <p>Last Friday, Robert Mustacchi shared
<a href="http://illumos.org/books/dev/">a great guide</a> that new developers
can reference when working with the illumos build system. As I was
reading it, I came across the section on
<a href="http://illumos.org/books/dev/workflow.html#testing">testing changes</a>
in the basic
workflow chapter. In that section Mustacchi gave some general guidelines
on how a developer should decide the way in which their changes should be
tested.</p>

<p>Recently on illumos-core, I was working on an
<a href="https://github.com/gdamore/illumos-core/issues/10">issue</a>
that had the goal of
removing some legacy code and required me to delete content from many files
(around 293). After I made my edits and did a full nightly build, no errors
showed up in my logs and I was able to boot into my new system.
Garrett D&rsquo;Amore reviewed my code to make sure that nothing suspicious was
going on.</p>

<p>The problem was that many of the files that I had changed were drivers/systems
that my system didn&rsquo;t even use (random device drivers or SPARC-specific files).
Since I am fairly new to illumos and kernel development in general, I had no
idea how to test these specific changes. Luckily, D&rsquo;Amore pointed me to the
<a href="http://illumos.org/man/1onbld/wsdiff">wsdiff(1)</a> utility.</p>

<p>As you can see from the man page, if you keep your proto area before applying
your changes, you can use it with wsdiff to find differences in the binaries
between &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; your changes. One thing to remember is that DEBUG
builds tend to carry debug macros which emit line numbers (e.g <code>__LINE__</code> macro)
so if you run wsdiff between two DEBUG builds to test your changes, be sure that
some, if not all, differences will come from there. (Check option -d of wsdiff
for other relevant info)</p>

<p>Taking the issue that I mentioned above as an example, running plain wsdiff
after my changes, a report with a huge amount of differences was generated,
due to line numbers. Thus, I had to do two full non-DEBUG builds to make sure
that my binaries stayed the same after my changes. Apparently it is also
possible to invoke wsdiff through <a href="http://illumos.org/man/1onbld/nightly">nightly(1)</a>, looking at Example 4 from
the wsdiff man page.</p>

<p>Besides my case-study of removing legacy code though, I believe that wsdiff
has its place in testing for other situations as well. Examples can be changes
that touch a lot of files or have to do with libraries. Basically, any change
that risks changing binaries that you are not supposed to, by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A big thanks to Nick Zivkovic for pointing out mistakes in the initial
version of this post.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: I suggested adding a section about this to the original guide.
The above information is now
<a href="https://github.com/illumos/dev-guide/commit/3fcf78337e4177a811013a4845166b58f76d2038">part of the dev-guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: The original title on my old Wordpress website was
&ldquo;Notes on Testing: Nuking Legacy code at illumos-core&rdquo;</p>
