     <p>Doing sequential reads on a working set that is cached in the ARC should yield
the best case performance for reads in ZFS, as disk accesses are avoided. An
experiment like this can uncover CPU bottlenecks in the read codepath from the
moment the read is issued to the ARC access and back.
<code>sequential_reads_arc_cached.ksh</code> which is used to test for performance
regressions does exactly that.</p>
<p>An interesting detail of this test is that running it on a system that
just booted, gives consistently better results the first time compared to
subsequent times. On one of my test machines I&rsquo;ve seen results of 10950 MB/s
on the first run dropping to 8689 MB/s in subsequent runs. The reason is that,
in the first run of the test in a fresh machine, the dbuf cache is being
populated for the first time and there is no need to evict anything. This is
unlike subsequent runs that need to evict entries from the dbuf cache in order
to cache their dbufs.</p>
<p>While root-causing the issue with Matt and analyzing the flamegraphs from the
different runs, I decided to take some notes and share them as I believe this
information can be of value to others.</p>
<h2 id="the-flamegraph">The Flamegraph</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The bottom of the flamegraph indicates three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU is never idle.</li>
<li>The majority of the time is spent in the read codepath.</li>
<li>Some portion of the CPU time is spent on the dbuf-eviction thread. This part
indicates how much time ZFS spends evicting dbufs.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Under <code>zfs_read()</code> time is spent in three places. The majority of the time is
spent <code>dmu_buf_hold_array_by_dnode()</code> where we read the actual blocks from the
ARC. Then there is <code>uiomove()</code>, which copies the data read into buffers that
will be eventually returned to the userspace. <code>uiomove()</code> is a good indicator
of the work being done (the bigger the percent spent there, the more IOPS we
get in general). Finally, there is a small amount of time spent releasing the
buffers ZFS was holding.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Inside <code>dmu_buf_hold_array_by_dnode()</code> there are two paths that call into
<code>dbuf_read()</code> to read buffers from the ARC. The one that is called directly
from <code>dmu_buf_hold_array_by_dnode()</code> gets the data that will be copied by
<code>uiomove()</code> to the buffers returned to the userspace. This is the data the
application that issued the read cares about.</p>
<p>The other path to <code>dbuf_read()</code> is through <code>dbuf_hold()</code>. In general, these
calls indicate time spent reading indirect blocks. Since the experiment
recorded by the flamegraph was doing only sequential reads, it is not
suprising that the amount spent reading indirect blocks is minimal.</p>
