<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Two semesters ago, I was introduced to gdb in my systems
programming course. Since this was the first time that I
used an actual debugger, I was really impressed by the
things it could do. I wanted to see what gdb was capable
of, so I tried every single command on simple programs.
Unfortunately, by the time I actually needed gdb in my
class projects I forgot most of them.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was just using gdb whenever I got
segmentation faults from my programs. I would quickly run
to the point where the program had the segmentation fault
and print a bunch of variables to see what was wrong with
it. Sometimes, I&rsquo;d also do a backtrace. This is probably
more than enough for small and simple programs but when
complexity grows it barely helps debugging. On many
occasions, the bug originates in a point in the code that
is distant from the point in the program where the
existence of the bug became apparent. In these cases, just
skimming to the end where the error shows up, doesn&rsquo;t
really help.</p>

<p>Being a tutor for CS classes in my school, I had a lot of
students that had buggy programs which misbehaved this way.
Since their programs had a large number of lines for course
projects, I decided to encourage them to use gdb more often
and learn more commands. Although that helped 30% of the
students, the majority of them still had problems. They
didn&rsquo;t want to use gdb because it was really tedious and
repetitive for them.</p>

<p>They were right! Most of their bugs would show up randomly
in a function after the 20th time that function was executed
and still they weren&rsquo;t able to tell if the bug started before
that function was called. Trying to figure out the root cause
of the problem by running gdb in interactive mode was a pain.
They would prefer looking at their source again and again to
figure out the problem. Some of them would even rewrite their
code using different (and usually more complex) program logic,
hoping that the bug would go away.</p>

<p>I decided to have a look at the scripting capabilities of gdb
and maybe try to help the students efficiently. I did find
some useful information actually and managed to help a lot of
students by showing them how to run gdb scripts. This whole
experience motivated me to write this small tutorial on basic
gdb scripting. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I secretly like the challenge
of debugging in programming. Also, scripting gdb is really easy
and it doesn&rsquo;t take that much time to teach. On the other hand,
I would prefer spending my time as a tutor actually teaching
people new material and not have my brain fried after trying
to understand/debug some person&rsquo;s code for hours.</p>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>By default during startup, gdb executes the file <code>.gdbinit</code>.
This is where you write your gdb code. In case you want to
have many scripts that test different things, you can tell
gdb to look at other scripts besides the default one by adding
the <code>--command=&lt;filename&gt;</code> argument when running gdb.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you want a backtrace every time a specific
function is called. This is extremely useful when debugging
recursive functions!. You would write the following code:</p>

<pre><code>set pagination off
set logging file gdb.output
set logging on

# This line is a comment
break function_name
    command 1
    backtrace
    continue
end

run

set logging off
quit
</code></pre>

<p>So what happens here? I turn pagination off so I don&rsquo;t have to
press Enter for every page of gdb output. I declare that I want
to log all the output of gdb in a file called <code>gdb.output</code>. Then
I start logging gdb&rsquo;s output and I set a breakpoint in my function.
I use <code>command &lt;breakpoint number&gt;</code> (this case 1, because
<code>function_name</code> is our first break point) to provide the commands
that I want to be ran whenever gdb hits that breakpoint. As you
can see I just print a backtrace and then continue until gdb hits
another breakpoint. Now that everything is set, I run the program
and when that finishes, I stop logging the output and quit gdb.
That&rsquo;s it! Now I can run gdb once and take a look at its output by
opening <code>gdb.output</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, if your program takes certain arguments you can pass
them as arguments in gdb. For example, run
<code>gdb --args ./a.out arg1 arg2 ...etc</code>. Another way is finding the
line that you execute <code>run</code> on your script and change it to
<code>run arg1 arg2 ...etc</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time though, you don&rsquo;t really need all this output.
What if you needed to break in a function when a certain parameter
of that function is passed a specific value? What if you needed to
break to a certain line of code the 3rd time it is executed? You
can do all these as I am going to show in the example below. So
let&rsquo;s say, I want to break in function1 when one of its arguments,
<code>param1</code>, is 32. I also want to break in line 142 of <code>file.c</code> when the
variable <code>x</code> (which is in the same scope with the statement in line
142) is bigger than 4. Finally I want to set a breakpoint in
<code>function2</code> and I want gdb to break the first 3 times this function
is executed.</p>

<pre><code>set pagination off
set logging file gdb.output
set logging on

set $var = 0 # yes, you can declare variables ...

break function1 if param1 == 32
    command 1
    print param2
    print param3-&gt;member1
    continue
end

break file.c:142 if x &gt; 4
    command 2
    print y
    call checker_function
    continue
end

break function2 if $var++ &lt; 3
    command 3
    print $var
    backtrace full
    continue
end

run

set logging off
quit
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! This is the end of this tutorial. In my
humble opinion the above are more or less enough for
programs of little to medium complexity. You can go
ahead and learn more advanced features of gdb or research
dynamic tracing that has been slowly coming to Linux
(most UNIX platforms have that already). Even if you don&rsquo;t
program actively on your own for the time being, knowing
how to run and script a debugger helps a lot in the
improvement of open source programs. For example, if your
favourite program suddenly crashes and you can send a
crash/bug report, attaching a simple backtrace and other
gdb output that displays extra information will save a lot
of time for the developers that will try to fix your problem.</p>

<h3 id="some-final-notes">Some Final Notes</h3>

<p>Before I finish this post, I just want to give a piece of
advice when using gdb. If your program crashes for whatever
reason and you have a rough idea where that happens, just
look at the relevant part of code for a while to see if it
makes sense. We often type things by mistake when we are
absent-minded that compile and give off-by-one and other
types of errors. If that part of code is complex just go
through it using gdb in interactive mode, don&rsquo;t start
writing/editing scripts right away that target a bug you
just found. You may actually spend more time writing a
script to find a bug than actually stepping through your
program in your head or using a debugger.</p>

<p>I would also like to encourage writing more checker functions
in your source code that check conditions (or print out debug
info on the program output during development) than huge gdb
scripts with complicated logic. Checker function in your source
can be called directly from your program AND from your gdb
scripts too (see 2nd example script). Besides, checker function
provide more flexible access to the internals of your program
and they are written in the same language as the rest of your
program.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A big thanks to Nick Zivkovic for pointing out some
mistakes in the initial version of this post.</p>
