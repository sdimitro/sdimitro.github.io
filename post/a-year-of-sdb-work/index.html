     <p>Since the time I joined Delphix, it feels like I’ve always had at least one
side-project that’s debugger-related. As we were based on illumos initially,
most of these projects were around MDB. Some of those were polished and made it
upstream (e.g. smart-write and support for incomplete unions in CTF) while
others remained in the prototype stage in my home directory (support for Java,
Lua scripting capabilities, etc..). Transitioning to Linux, a debugger that
supported our existing processes and use cases was a big question mark in our
plan. At this time, a bit over a year ago, I made replacing that question mark
my side-project and with the support of the whole Systems Platforms team within
Delphix in both resources and technical contributions, I think we finally have
a solid plan.</p>

<p>After surveying existing solutions (<code>gdb</code>, <code>kgdb/kdb</code>, <code>crash</code>, and
<code>crash-python</code>), considering porting tools from other platforms (<code>mdb</code> and
<code>acid</code>), and even creating our own debugger from scratch, we decided on
creating sdb — a solution that combined all of the above. SDB is a debugger
very similar to MDB, written from scratch in Python, and it leverages most of
its capabilities from drgn, which in turn depends on common Linux libraries
like <code>libelf</code> and <code>libdwfl</code>. The debugger itself is far from being done, yet I
believe it’s at a stage now that anybody can give it a spin and even try it in
production. In addition, while examining all of the above options, we got to
create contacts and bring a few people together in a group to discuss the
current issues and the future direction of kernel debugging tools in Linux. If
you are interested, feel free to subscribe to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/access-error?continue=https://groups.google.com/g/linux-kernel-debugging-community">mailing
list</a>,
<a href="https://linux-kernel-debug.slack.com/">slack workspace</a>, or email me to
receive an invite for one of our upcoming monthly meetings.</p>

<p>In retrospect the highlights of the year for the project have been the
following in chronological order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>April 8th - All potential options with detailed plans and their requirements
are put on the table.</p></li>

<li><p>May 2nd -  Prakash Surya and I hacked together the initial prototype of sdb
on top of crash-python.</p></li>

<li><p>May 6th - The whole Systems Platforms team had a work-week hacking on sdb.
The results were: SDB Pipes by Matt Ahrens and Paul Dagnelie, blkptr by Don
Brady, zfs_dbgmsg by Paul, stacks by Sara Hartse and John Gallagher, arcstat by
Prashanth Sreenivasa, and spa/vdev by George Wilson. In addition, Tom Caputi
and Prakash enabled crash-python to work for live-systems (a solution that we
still use today while support for function arguments insdb on top of drgn is
still a WIP). Finally, Pavel Zakharov drew the first and only picture of the
SDB mascot to this date.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>May 19th - Creation of <code>sdb</code> prototype on top of <code>drgn</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>June 23rd - Prakash finished single-handedly porting the majority of the
crash-python based code to the new prototype based on <code>drgn</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>June 25th - With the help of Karyn Ritter we were able to open-source sdb
under the Apache License 2.0.</p></li>

<li><p>June 26th - The first Linux Kernel Debugging Community meeting took place
online through Zoom where people from multiple companies, including the
creators of <code>crash-python</code> (<a href="https://github.com/jeffmahoney">Jeff Mahoney</a>) and
<code>drgn</code> (<a href="https://github.com/osandov">Omar Sandoval</a>), got to discuss the
current issues and status of the existing debugging tools.</p></li>

<li><p>September 9th - The <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers
Conference</a> of 2019 took place in Lisbon.
Omar presented DRGN in the tracing track while George Wilson and I introduced
SDB in a BoF. Unfortunately BoFs are not recorded so there is no video of our
presentation.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>November 4th - The <a href="http://open-zfs.org/wiki/OpenZFS_Developer_Summit">OpenZFS Dev Summit of
2019</a> took place in San
Francisco. I presented SDB there in the context of debugging ZFS on Linux. A
few people decided to work on SDB during the hackathon with two of them ending
up being in the finalists. Sara Hartse got 2nd place with her SDB walker for
B-Trees in ZFS and Jordan Hendricks in the 3rd place with her metadata
pretty-printer for kernel mutexes.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<ul>
<li>December 11th - SDB reaches an important stability and usability milestone
(at least for me personally). We have a new test-suite that is not based on
mocks which enables us to thoroughly tests all of our commands, <a href="https://codecov.io/gh/delphix/sdb">code coverage
statistics</a>, and preliminary type-checks
through mypy. All of these are fully automated and extensible through Github
actions brought to you by Prakash. On the usability side, a ton of bugs were
filled and fixed by Matt, Prakash, and <a href="https://github.com/ctuffli">Chuck
Tuffli</a>. Highlights include: Coercing correctly at
every point within a pipeline, auto-generating help messages from comments in
the source, and maintaining the SDB session when dealing with buggy commands or
Ctrl+c.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is still a ton of work to be done on SDB and I’m excited to see what we
do next.</p>
