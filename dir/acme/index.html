<h2>Acme: A User Interface for Programmers</h2>

<hr>

Around April 2016 I started playing with Acme,
a powerful text editor and development environment
developed by Rob Pike. I installed Acme through
Russ Cox's plan9port.
You can find the latest version of his code
<a href="https://github.com/9fans/plan9port">here</a>.
One thing that I believe that Acme lacks (but not
necessarily needs!) is a place that hosts resources
that can help newcomers and potentially more advanced
users of Acme to become more productive with the editor.
This page is an attempt to be that place.

The above may seem too generic but they are actually sufficient to get
you started and understand the spirit of Acme. Unfortunately since
many of them are posted on blogs and blogs tend to get deleted
pretty often, I will try at some point to share my notes/scripts from
them online in case they get deleted. One thing at a time :-)
