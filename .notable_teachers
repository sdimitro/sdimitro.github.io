Hi there :-)
============

Notable Teachers (Whom I owe a lot)
===================================
__Dimitris Mantzabinos__

 Besides the beauty of mathematics, he showed me how rewarding it is to follow your passion.

__Ntinos Tsoutsikas__

Imagination is everything. Also, once you've applied an equation to a physics problem, your view of mathematics changes forever.

__Xristos Korakakis__

Define your goal and all the intermediate steps that lead to it. Now, start working.

__Dimitris Tsoutsikas__

The importance of refining by practising. Introducing me to a life-long friend, the classical guitar.

__Kwstas Xalbatzis__

The Beauty of Geometry. Also, don't make any assumptions if you can't prove them.

__Dimos Pallas__

How to deal with strict examiners & colleagues.

__Edward M. Reingold__

Showed me the Beauty of Algorithmic Analysis and Mathematical Proofs, the importance of precise definitions and notation, and good humor.

__Arthur Lubin__

Taught me Probabilities and Statistics properly.

__Mattox Beckman__

Introduced me to Lisp. Taught me how beneficial are abstractions in programming when done right. Motto: "Make the computer work for you! Never work for the computer!"

__Michael Lee__

Understanding and dealing with complex systems. Showed me the true power of Lisp.

__Edward Stuart__

Taught me how the circus-economy on the US works and how to deal with it.

__Virgil Bistriceanu__

"You should make money when you can, not when you need them", "You should hire great engineers when you find them, not when you need them".

__Michael McCourt__

Be cool! - "Who cares about these shit anyway, life goes on, let's go home."

__Others that I unfortunately met briefly:__

__Robert Ellis, Michael Pelsmajer, Suresh Borkar, Matthew Bauer, and Mustafa Bilgic__
