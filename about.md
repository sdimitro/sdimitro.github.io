Hi there!

My name is Serapheim Dimitropoulos and I use this site to share
my work with computers. Occasionally I may post about my activities
outside of work. My main technical interests are operating systems
and systems software in general, but once in a while I like to
read about fancy algorithms and their analysis. Below is a picture
of me hiking in Seattle, WA.
